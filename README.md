# COM3D2-Arc-Outfits-Extractor
This tool allows users to extract every outfit file in specific arc files. This only extracts outfit files, no more, no less. These files can then be loaded as mods and even modified.

To be clear, this tool doesn't actually just extract clothing files but any files that can be found within edit mode. Hair, faces, clothes, whatever. It'll pull those files out and any related to them.

# Main Points #
- Extract outfit files from specific arc files.
- Extract outfit files from all arc files in a given directory
- Load extracted files as a mod, compatible with any game version.

# Usage #
1. Open the Application
2. Select your arc files, whether by selecting their directory or selecting them each individually
3. Select where your files are to be placed. It is recommended you create an empty folder and place the output there.
4. The folder you just created can be loaded as a mod into your mods folder and the outfits will appear in-game.
